# CMPSC 480: Course Contract

## A word from the instructor

> In most learning situations in life outside of school, grades are never given.
The learning that occurs in cooking, dance, or yoga studios
do not use any grading. Why? In these “studio” cases, it seems meaningless to
give students grades, and yet without any grades, those students get better at yoga, dance, and cooking.

> Asao Inoue, "160W's Grading Contract"

Nearly everything you've done during your time at various learning institutions has resolved to single point: the final grade. Whether this was a quarterly, annual, or semi-annual grade (i.e. semester grade), your education has formatted you towards achieving the best letter grade outcome possible. That's not (mostly) how this course goes, however.

I recognize there as many reasons for taking this particular course as there are students enrolled in it; that's the nature of an open-ended class aimed at career development. Our interests will vary widely, and the conversations we have may equally wander.

I write above that this course will "mostly" not be contingent on grades. In fact, I want you to exile the idea of grading from your brain completely. The idea of failure often precludes us from taking risks for fear that we'll look or feel inferior or, at worst, be incapable of understanding a concept. Unfortunately, the inevitability of letter grades often amplifies that fear, as it's a very real consequence.

But this course is less about "making the grade" than it is giving you skills and tools to conquer problems. Of course, you may ask "what 'problems' does professional development imply?"

In fact, I care more about your excitement and confidence with the material than I do about grades. Grades are the _worst_.

This semester -- at least up to the point where the college requires that I assign you an individual letter grade -- is _ungraded_, meaning you will never see an actual letter grade from me on an assignment. Instead, I will provide formative feedback. Does that mean you can't get anything _wrong_? No, of course not. You'll still have plenty of opportunity and encouragement to fail. All this means is that `failure != "F"`. The only thing that leads to failure here is inauthentic effort.

At the end of the semester, I have to give you a grade. But, following this contract should take care of that.

In this course, we will rely on a contract to determine what kinds of behaviors lead to learning and personal/professional growth. We will spend the opening class sessions of this course working together to identify and codify those things that we will hold ourselves and others accountable to. In fact, this class relies on more than just a sense of community to function: it relies on actual community rules and efforts. I include myself as part of this course community, so this contract also indemnifies _me and the course Technical Leaders (TLs)_ to uphold the behaviors and expectations written into it.

So what does all this mean? Perhaps it's important to identify what it _doesn't mean_: this course is not one where you will be able to just "get by." In fact, ungraded contract courses, historically, require _more_ work than graded ones. However, you are rewarded for completing work to a satisfactory degree, a statement which we will use this contract to clarify.

Here, you are rewarded for the quality of your honest work. Like many other areas of inquiry, as you you participate in this discipline you'll learn that you're really developing a _practice_ -- a work that presages attempt, failure, _and_ success all at once -- in learning how to present yourself and your work professionally.

For all of you, the terrain of this journey will be tough in different ways. It's my sincere hope that spelling out the boundaries of the map will make it at least traversable.

## Contract stipulations

### Grading

Each assignment will feature a "tier"-based requirements structure based on the different strata described below. These requirements contemplate the additional work that transports an assignment from "good" to "great," and often involves a higher workload of more than just repetition or make-work.

#### The "Basic Grade"

(To qualify for this tier, all basic assignment objectives must be completely met.)

* All students who meet the covenants of this contract will earn an individual letter grade of `B` in this course.

#### Tiers

As written above, each assignment will specify two different acceptable levels of work:

* `A` tier requirements: work which often involves extended reflection or application of concepts/products
* `Basic` tier requirements: work which achieves a product, but does not elaborate on or apply said product

It is possible to occupy `+`/`-` regions of the grading spectrum. The following table summarizes how these
incidentals work:

|Mark            |Criteria                                                                                 |
|:---------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`A-`            |A student has completed `A` tier work on all assignments except two (2) for the semester |
|`B+`            |A student completes two (2) assignments to `A` tier quality                              |
|`B-`            |See [Incomplete assignments](#incomplete-assignments) below                              |

### Grades lower than the "Basic Grade"

There are three (3) instances that penalize evaluation:

1. Incomplete assignments (i.e. basic expectations are not fulfilled)
2. Ignored assignments (i.e. not completed at all)
3. Plagiarism or other inappropriate/dishonest academic behavior

Each of these circumstances affects grades differently.

#### Incomplete assignments

For every two (2) incomplete assignments, a student's course grade will be lowered by half a letter grade (e.g. _two_ (2) incomplete assignments would result in a mark of `B-`, et al.).

#### Ignored assignments

If a student misses _any_ assignment, their course grade is lowered by a half letter grade for each (e.g. _one_ (1) assignment missed would result in a `B-`, et al.).

#### Academic dishonesty

Students engaging in academically dishonest behavior will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, as circumstances and factors of a case vary widely. However, in situations where academic dishonesty is established, the variety of penalties might include (but are not limited to):

* disqualification from the `A` and/or "Basic Grade" tiers
* an automatic assessment of an "Ignored" assignment

In severe cases, academic dishonesty may result in the mark of an `F` for the course, though these cases are rare (i.e. _almost_ non-existent). For questions of what qualifies under the provision of "academic dishonesty" see the remainder of this document and the _Compass_.

### Assignment "bugs" and impact on grading

* In the event that there are "bugs" with grader criteria, instructor will assess completion status with known issues in mind
  * The instructor will make every effort to remedy the failing check before the assignment due date
  * However, if during assignment evaluation, a check fails for every student due to a technical issue, the check is considered an invalid grading criteria  

### The "Repair Rule" (i.e. Assignment Revision)

This rule only applies to assignments classified as "Incomplete" assignments and _not "Ignored" assignments.

* _Once_ during the semester, a student may open an Issue on a repository to which they'd like to submit missing work to regain credit for an assignment
  * This issue should indicate a student's interest in reclaiming credit for this assignment using the "Repair Rule"
* This "Repair" issue must fill out the resulting form completely to request the ability to submit revisions
* Students submitting a revision must remedy deficiencies listed in the most recent "Checkpoint" issue
  * Credit will be awarded as "complete" or "incomplete" according to the guidelines outlined in the [Grading](#Grading) section above
* A student submitting a revision is allowed five (5) days to submit updated work
  * There is no limit on the number of `commit`s allowed during this time (i.e. students may `commit` as many times as they like)
